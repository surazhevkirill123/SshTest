Do the impossible
See the invisible
Row! Row!
Fight the power!

Touch the untouchable
Break the unbreakable
Row! Row!
Fight the power!

1 coup
Power to the peeps, power for the dream
Still missing piece scattering, so incomplete
We be the most incredible soldier from underground
See how easy, they all fall down

Digging to the core to see the light
Let's get out of here babe, that's the way to survive, ya
Top of the head, I'm on the set
Do the impossible, don't you wanna bet?

Cuz, a lot of things changed, we be waiting in vain
If you wanna get by, no pain no gain
Wow! Fakers wanna test me again
Sorry, my rhyme's gonna snatch your brain, yo

I'm still starving for the straight up shit
We gonna make it happen with the crazy rap skill
Get ready to rumble, now is the time, uh huh
If you ain't know, now you know

Good luck fellows!

2 coup
2nd verse dedicates to the real peeps
What we got to say is so real thing
Cuz, revolution ain't never gonna televise
Kicking the mad flow, microphone phenotype
Open your third eye, seeing through the overground
I'm about to hit you with the scream from the underground
Whole city is covered with the cyber flavor
“G” is in your area, one of the toughest enigma.

Do the impossible
See the invisible
Row! Row!
Fight the power!
Touch the untouchable
Break the unbreakable
Row! Row!
Fight the power!
What you gonna do is what you wanna do
Just break the rule, then you see the truth
This is the theme of “G” coming through baby!
Row! Row!
Fight the power!

Fight the power!
